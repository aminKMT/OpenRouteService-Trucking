Development Process with GitHub

GitHub is our preferred platform for hosting code, tracking issues, and managing feature requests.

Please note that any contributions you make will be covered under the MIT Software License.

Reporting Bugs

We utilize GitHub issues to track public bugs. Reporting a bug is as simple as opening a new issue. We encourage you to provide detailed bug reports, including relevant background information and sample code whenever possible. To assist you in writing effective bug reports, you can refer to the comprehensive bug report guide available on Stack Overflow. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community to understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and identify related issues.
